# Advent of Code 2024
These are my solutions for the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Disclaimer
These are most likely not the most efficient or clean solutions as I started the challenge 3 days before Christmas and the goal is to get through as much of it as possible before the new year ðŸ˜„.

## Getting Started
This project is written using Python ^3.13 using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as a dependency manager and formatted using [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff). 

Ex:
```
uv run ./challenges/day6/part1.py
```
To format:
```
uv run ruff format
uv run ruff check --fix
```

Enjoy!
